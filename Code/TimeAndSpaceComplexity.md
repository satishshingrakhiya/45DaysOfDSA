## Time Complexity
An algorithm's time complexity specifies how long it will take to execute an algorithm as a function of its input size.

## Space Complexity
An algorithm's space complexity specifies the total amount of space or memory required to execute an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

## In Big O, there are six major types of complexities (time and space):

Constant: O(1) - Excellent/Best

Logarithmic time: O(log n) - Good

Linear time: O(n) - Fair

Logarithmic time: O(n log n) - Bad

Quadratic time: O(n^2) - Worst

Exponential time: O(2^n) - Worst

Factorial time: O(n!) - Horrible

## How to identify time complexity
When your calculation is not dependent on the input size, it is a constant time complexity (O(1)).

When the input size is reduced by half, maybe when iterating, handling recursion, or whatsoever, it is a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)).

When you have a single loop within your algorithm, it is linear time complexity (O(n)).

When you have nested loops within your algorithm, meaning a loop in a loop, it is quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)).

When the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input, it is exponential time complexity (O2^n).

## Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
